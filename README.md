## Hi, I'm David! Welcome to my profile. 👋

Honestly? I'm still a novice at programming/software engineering, but I'm working bit by bit to get better every day.
I've worked on multiple projects ranging from full-stack web development to Salesforce. If you want to know more about me, check out my portfolio site!

- 🛠️ I’m currently working a simple program in Qt Creator.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about software development in Qt Creator.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate and network with others in my local area!
- 💬 Ask me about my worst death in Darkest Dungeon 1.
- 📫 How to reach me: Check the sidebar!
- 🟧 Fun fact: My favorite color is orange.

Ok, that's all for now. Bye!
